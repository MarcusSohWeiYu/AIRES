# Meet the Team

**ProcoLink** was founded by [Siew Wei Heng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-heng/) and [Jet Palmero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jet-palmero/), who invited me to join them as part of the founding AI software engineering team. Together with [Siew Wei Heng](\https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-heng/), [Anson Oh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anson-oh/), and [Lee Guan Feng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-guan-feng/), we developed **AIRES**‚Äîan AI-First Call Center Solution designed to transform the future of tech support.

As a team, we iterate on design prototypes, plan software architecture, and code to bring AIRES to life. Our collaborative efforts and shared vision have enabled us to create a product that not only addresses the needs of modern businesses but also sets a new standard for AI-driven customer service.

We partnered with [Computer Guys](https://comguys.com/), a tech support company, and visited their office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to understand their tech support workflow, which helped us refine and enhance AIRES.
